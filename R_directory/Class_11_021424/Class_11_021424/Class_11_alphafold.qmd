# ALL ABOUT ALPHAFOLD

Link to lab: https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_W24/class-material/class11_alphafold.html#generating-your-own-structure-predictions

To run it, use the GPU notebook to avoid using space on your laptop using the AlphaFold notebooks. There are many other notebooks available: https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold

# Goal: Find conserved sites by finding convserved AA and the regions using molstar.


```{r}
pth <- "HIV1dimer_23119"

list.files(path=pth)
```

Returning the full file name (i.e with the directory path) of the alignment file (a3m).

```{r}
list.files(path=pth, pattern = ".a3m", full.names = TRUE)

aln.file <- list.files(path=pth, pattern = ".a3m", full.names = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(bio3d)
aln <- read.fasta(aln.file, to.upper = TRUE)
```

Let's look at the alignment. 
```{r}
dim(aln$ali)
```

Let's get some summary of the alignment such as conservation scores.

```{r}
sim <- conserv(aln)
head(sim)
```

The sim file will have scores per column:

```{r}
plot(sim, typ="h")
```

We can summarize these conserved columns (the ones with high scores above) via a consensus sequences. 

In the result below, AA DTGA are the most conserved (with a threshold of 90%)

```{r}
consensus(aln, cutoff = 0.9)
```


We will now read the Predicted Alignment Error (PAE) files to make sense of the multichains. These are stored as JSON format.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

pae_files <- list.files(path=pth,
                        pattern= "000.json",
                        full.names = TRUE)

pae1 <- read_json(pae_files[1],simplifyVector = TRUE)
pae5 <- read_json(pae_files[5],simplifyVector = TRUE)
```


Get an idea of the structure of the data:

```{r}
dim(pae1$pae)
```

Let's plot this distance matrix:

```{r}
plot.dmat(pae5$pae)
```
```{r}
plot.dmat(pae1$pae)
```
```{r}

```
